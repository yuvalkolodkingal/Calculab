# AGENTS.md

**Precedence:** the **closest `AGENTS.md`** to the files you're changing wins. Root holds global defaults only.

## Response Style
- Answer first, elaborate only if needed. No sycophantic openers ("Great question!", "Absolutely!").
- For yes/no or status questions, lead with the answer.
- Skip preamble. Match response length to task complexity.

## Workflow
1. **Before coding**: Read nearest `AGENTS.md` + check Golden Samples for the area you're touching
2. **After each change**: Run the smallest relevant check (lint → typecheck → single test)
3. **Before committing**: Run full test suite if changes affect >2 files or touch shared code
4. **Before claiming done**: Run verification and **show output as evidence** — never say "try again", "should work now", "tested", "verified", or "all green" without pasted command output in the same turn

## Boundaries

### Always Do
- Run pre-commit checks before committing
- Add tests for new code paths
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): subject`
- Use **atomic commits** (one logical change per commit); preserve signatures, keep bisection useful
- **Show test output as evidence before claiming work is complete** — never say "try again", "should work now", "tested", "verified", or "all green" without pasted command output
- Before any edit, verify `pwd` resolves inside the intended repo worktree — not `.bare/`, not `~/.claude/skills/…`, not `~/.claude/plugins/cache/…` (those are read-only caches that get clobbered on update)
- For upstream dependency fixes: run **full** test suite, not just affected tests
- Force-push only with `--force-with-lease`
{{LANGUAGE_CONVENTIONS}}

### Ask First
- Adding new dependencies
- Modifying CI/CD configuration
- Changing public API signatures
- Running full e2e test suites
- Repo-wide refactoring or rewrites
- Operations that touch >3 repos (produce a dry-run plan first)

### Never Do
- Commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- Modify vendor/, node_modules/, or generated files
- Push directly to main/master branch — open a PR
- Merge a PR before all review threads are resolved
- Squash commits during merge or rebase unless the user explicitly asked
- Edit installed skill/plugin cache paths (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, `**/.bare/**`) — always the source worktree
- Reply to review comments with bare "Addressed" or "Fixed" — cite the resolving commit SHA
- Delete migration files or schema changes
- Use `secrets: inherit` in reusable GitHub Actions workflows (pass secrets explicitly)

## Contributing (for AI agents)
- **Comprehension**: Understand the problem before submitting code. Read the linked issue, understand *why* the change is needed, not just *what* to change.
- **Context**: Every PR must explain the trade-offs considered and link to the issue it addresses. Disclose AI assistance if the project requires it.
- **Continuity**: Respond to review feedback. Drive-by PRs without follow-up will be closed.

## Scoped AGENTS.md (MUST read when working in these directories)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START scope-index -->
{{SCOPE_INDEX}}
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END scope-index -->

> **Agents**: When you read or edit files in a listed directory, you **must** load its AGENTS.md first. It contains directory-specific conventions that override this root file.

## When instructions conflict
The nearest `AGENTS.md` wins. Explicit user prompts override files.
