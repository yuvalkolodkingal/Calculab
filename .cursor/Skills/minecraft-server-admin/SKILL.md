# Minecraft Server Administration Skill

## Scope and Routing Boundaries

### Routing Boundaries
- `Use when`: the task is infrastructure or live operations for Minecraft servers (deployment choice, tuning, backups, proxying, security, incident response).
- `Do not use when`: the task is writing plugin code (`minecraft-plugin-dev`) or writing mods/loaders (`minecraft-modding`, `minecraft-multiloader`).
- `Do not use when`: the task is WorldEdit command workflows (`minecraft-worldedit-ops`) or EssentialsX workflow/policy design (`minecraft-essentials-ops`).
- `Do not use when`: the task is datapack/resource-pack authoring (`minecraft-datapack`, `minecraft-resource-pack`).

## Support Assets

- Read `references/deployment-checklists.md` when the task is an incident, rollout window, proxy change, or recovery drill and you need a compact checklist before acting.

---

## Deployment Decision Matrix

Use this table first. Pick a deployment type before changing configs.

| Deployment profile | Recommended stack | Pick this when | Watch-outs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small SMP on Paper | Paper only | Up to ~30 concurrent players, broad plugin compatibility, low ops overhead | Do not over-tune early; profile before changing many defaults |
| Larger public Paper server | Paper + Spark + stricter plugin/change control | Public server with frequent joins, moderate plugin set, uptime matters | Plugin sprawl is the top TPS risk |
| Velocity-backed network | Velocity + multiple Paper backends | Hub/minigame/factions split across servers, need shared entrypoint | Forwarding/auth mismatches can block joins |
| Purpur gameplay-heavy server | Purpur (optionally behind Velocity) | You want gameplay knobs exposed in config without custom plugin code | Extra toggles increase misconfiguration risk |
| Folia high-concurrency server | Folia + Folia-compatible plugins only | Very high concurrency with region-threading goals | Many plugins are not Folia-safe |
| Fabric/NeoForge mod server | Fabric or NeoForge server build | You require loader mods, custom content, modpack behavior | Bukkit/Paper plugins do not apply |

### Deployment Type Routing

- Small SMP and most public plugin servers: use Paper baseline first.
- Use Purpur only when you explicitly need Purpur gameplay controls.
- Use Folia only when plugin compatibility has been validated for region-threading.
- Use Velocity when one process is not enough or you need separate backend roles.
- Use Fabric/NeoForge when the requirement is mod-driven, not plugin-driven.

## Playbook: Performance Tuning

### Step 1: Establish baseline

Collect a baseline before edits:

```bash
free -h
top -b -n 1 | head -n 25
```

In server console:

```bash
tps
mspt
spark healthreport
```

Record:
- peak player count
- MSPT at idle and at peak activity
- top plugins by CPU from Spark report

### Step 2: Profile the real bottleneck

Use Spark instead of guesswork:

```bash
spark profiler --timeout 180
spark tps
spark tickmonitor --interval 10
```

Then identify whether the issue is:
- plugin task load
- entity count / mob farm pressure
- chunk generation / disk I/O
- garbage-collection pauses

### Step 3: Apply targeted fixes

Do not tune everything at once. Apply one group at a time.

1. Chunk and simulation pressure:
- lower `view-distance` and `simulation-distance` first
- pre-generate worlds for survival-heavy maps

1. Entity pressure:
- adjust despawn ranges and mob-spawn behavior in Paper world config
- cap problematic entities where appropriate

1. Plugin pressure:
- disable or replace top offenders from Spark traces
- reduce async task frequency where plugin settings allow

### Step 4: Use stable startup flags

For Java 21 on Paper/Purpur:

```bash
java -Xms10G -Xmx10G \
  -XX:+UseG1GC \
  -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled \
  -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 \
  -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions \
  -XX:+DisableExplicitGC \
  -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch \
  -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 \
  -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 \
  -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M \
  -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 \
  -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 \
  -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 \
  -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 \
  -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 \
  -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 \
  -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 \
  -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem \
  -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 \
  -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 \
  -jar server.jar --nogui
```

For under 12 GB memory budgets, reduce heap and use smaller region size.

### Step 5: Verify improvements

After each change set:

```bash
spark tps
spark healthreport
```

Keep the change only if MSPT/tick stability improves under representative load.

---

## Playbook: Plugin Operations

### Safe plugin change workflow

1. Build a plugin inventory:
- plugin name and version
- required dependencies
- minimum server version

1. Stage updates:
- apply plugin updates in staging first
- run smoke checks: joins, teleports, economy, permissions, saves

1. Production rollout window:
- announce maintenance window
- stop server cleanly
- snapshot plugin jars and config
- deploy update batch

1. Post-rollout verification:
- watch startup logs for API warnings
- run command and permission sanity checks
- track TPS/MSPT for 15-30 minutes

### Rollback checklist

- Keep previous plugin directory snapshot.
- If severe regression occurs:
  - stop server
  - restore prior plugin jars/configs
  - start and confirm login/world integrity
- Document failing plugin/version pair for future blocks.

---

## Playbook: Proxy and Forwarding (Velocity)

### Velocity baseline

`velocity.toml` essentials:

```toml
bind = "0.0.0.0:25565"
online-mode = true
player-info-forwarding-mode = "modern"
forwarding-secret-file = "forwarding.secret"
```

### Backend server requirements

`server.properties` on backend:

```properties
online-mode=false
```

Paper backend forwarding support (`config/paper-global.yml`):

```yaml
proxies:
  velocity:
    enabled: true
    online-mode: true
    secret: "paste-the-shared-forwarding-secret-here"
```

Use the same secret value stored in Velocity's `forwarding.secret` file; the backend
config takes the secret string itself, not a file path.

Keep `enforce-secure-profile` at the server default unless you are handling a
specific legacy-client or incident workaround. It is not part of the baseline
Velocity setup. Also confirm `settings.bungeecord: false` in `spigot.yml`; do
not enable BungeeCord forwarding and Velocity modern forwarding at the same time.

### Validation runbook

1. Confirm proxy port is reachable from clients.
2. Confirm backend is firewalled from direct internet access.
3. Join through proxy and verify:
- UUID consistency
- skin/profile forwarding
- plugin permission behavior

### Common proxy incidents

- "Invalid player info forwarding":
  - mismatch in forwarding mode or shared secret between Velocity and backend.
- Random auth/session failures:
  - mixed `online-mode` expectations or direct backend exposure.

## Playbook: Backup and Recovery

### Backup policy template

| Asset | Frequency | Retention | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| World folders (`world*`) | Hourly incremental + daily full | 7 daily, 4 weekly | Highest priority |
| `plugins/` and `config/` | Daily | 14 daily | Required for quick rollback |
| Proxy config/secrets | Daily | 30 daily | Store encrypted off-host |
| Container/orchestration files | On change + weekly | 8 weeks | Git-tracked where possible |

### Example backup script

For a production server, quiesce world writes before copying live world folders.
The example below assumes a maintenance window and a cleanly stopped server. If
you use RCON-based live backups instead, choose a client/secret mechanism that
does not expose the password in command arguments, flush chunks first, and test
the restore path before trusting the backup.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

DATE="$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)"
BACKUP_ROOT="/backups/minecraft"
SERVER_ROOT="/srv/minecraft"
DEST="${BACKUP_ROOT}/${DATE}"

mkdir -p "$DEST"

if pgrep -f "server.jar" >/dev/null; then
  echo "Refusing to archive a live server. Stop it cleanly or use a tested snapshot workflow." >&2
  exit 1
fi

tar -czf "${DEST}/worlds.tar.gz" -C "$SERVER_ROOT" world world_nether world_the_end
tar -czf "${DEST}/plugins-config.tar.gz" -C "$SERVER_ROOT" plugins config
cp "$SERVER_ROOT/server.properties" "$DEST/server.properties"
```

### Recovery drill (must be tested)

1. Stop server.
2. Restore selected backup to staging directory.
3. Validate ownership/permissions.
4. Start server in maintenance mode.
5. Verify:
- world spawn loads
- player data is readable
- key plugins initialize
1. Reopen to players.

Define targets:
- `RPO` (acceptable data loss window)
- `RTO` (acceptable restore duration)

## Playbook: Live Troubleshooting

### Incident triage flow

1. Classify incident:
- crash on startup
- severe lag / TPS collapse
- join/auth failures
- memory/disk pressure

1. Capture evidence first:

```bash
df -h
free -h
```

From server/proxy console:

```bash
spark tps
spark healthreport
```

1. Stabilize:
- stop risky rollout changes
- disable newest suspect plugin first
- reduce player impact (maintenance mode, temporary queue, restricted worlds)

1. Recover and document:
- apply rollback or hotfix
- document root cause and permanent preventive action

### Fast symptom map

| Symptom | First checks | Typical root cause |
|---|---|---|
| Startup crash after plugin update | latest logs, plugin dependency chain | incompatible plugin/API mismatch |
| High MSPT only at peak hours | Spark profiler, entity/chunk stats | mob farms, heavy scheduled tasks, chunk I/O |
| Players cannot join via proxy | forwarding mode + secret + backend exposure | Velocity/backend config mismatch |
| Periodic hard lag spikes | GC pauses + autosave + backup overlap | memory pressure, backup I/O contention |

---

## Operational Config Reference

### `server.properties` high-impact keys

```properties
max-players=100
view-distance=10
simulation-distance=8
sync-chunk-writes=true
max-tick-time=60000
enable-rcon=false
```

### `bukkit.yml` and `spigot.yml`

Use Spigot/Bukkit docs as authoritative for version-specific defaults and side effects.
Tune conservatively and re-measure after every change set.

### Paper config files

- `config/paper-global.yml`
- `config/paper-world-defaults.yml`

Adjust these only after profiling identifies an actionable bottleneck.

---

## Deployment Patterns

### Docker Compose (Paper)

```yaml
services:
  paper:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server:java21
    container_name: mc-paper
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
      TYPE: "PAPER"
      VERSION: "1.21.11"
      MEMORY: "10G"
    ports:
      - "25565:25565"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

This Docker example targets the repository's 1.21.x guidance and Java 21.
Minecraft 26.1.x/Paper 26.x requires Java 25 and Paper's 26.x version line; use
a Java 25 image and re-check plugin compatibility before changing `VERSION`.

### Pterodactyl/Wings notes

- Keep startup command and memory allocations consistent with tested JVM flags.
- Pin panel and Wings versions to supported combinations.
- Validate backup mount and restore workflow before production.

---

## Security Hardening Checklist

- Keep `online-mode=true` unless proxy forwarding requires backend `online-mode=false`.
- Never expose backend Paper ports directly when using Velocity.
- Restrict RCON and panel/admin surfaces by firewall/IP allowlist.
- Rotate secrets (`forwarding.secret`, panel credentials, backup credentials).
- Keep plugin sources trusted; verify checksum/release source before install.
- Maintain off-host encrypted backups.
- Keep Java runtime and host OS patched.
